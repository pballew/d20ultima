# Fonts

This folder is for custom/bundled fonts used by the game.

Recommended open-license medieval-style fonts:
- Cinzel Decorative (OFL)
- UnifrakturCook (OFL)
- UnifrakturMaguntia (OFL)
- MedievalSharp (OFL)
- IM FELL English SC (OFL)
 - Eagle Lake (OFL)

Place the TTF/OTF into this folder and the main menu will auto-detect and use it if it matches a known file name (e.g., EagleLake-Regular.ttf). Otherwise, the game falls back to system medieval-style fonts.
